# haildocker

please note: the Dockerfile builds successfully locally, but doesn't build on the docker cloud environment. 
Apparently this is due to scala settings in encrypted linux VMs.
if you download the docker recipe locally and build it, it should work.

alternatively, my docker library contains also built images which would work.
